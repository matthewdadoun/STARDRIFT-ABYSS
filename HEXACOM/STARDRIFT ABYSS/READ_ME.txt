Main things we need done:
- No sliding from moving left and right
- Single jumps (can only jump when grounded)
- Prevent movement when crouching
- Stop character from bouncing when hitting the ground

Extras:
- Have the camera follow the player
- Larger test stage with platforms and slopes

Notes:
- We need to use forces to move the character as setting velocity allows clipping through objects
- PlayerPosition and PlayerSpeed variables are now obsolete but left in
